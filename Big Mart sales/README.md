Big Mart Sales Data Cleaning

In this project, I will be cleaning the sales dataset of Big Mart, which was downloaded from Kaggle. 
I will be using the train.csv dataset of Big Mart, which can be found at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akashdeepkuila/big-mart-sales.

The cleaning process will involve the following tasks:

1) Filling in blank weight data based on the data pattern
2) Setting null outlet size to "Not Defined" for further visualization purposes
3) Separating outlet and outlet type information
4) Setting outlet type to Type4 for outlet grocery stores
5) Formatting sales amounts
